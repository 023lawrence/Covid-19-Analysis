This is a straightforward demonstration of how we can create various and intriguing charts, visualisations, and dashboards from the same data.

We asked the following queries before using the Covid-19 Dataset to produce graphics.

-> Which countries have the most confirmed cases overall?
-> How many recovered instances are there overall across all countries?
-> How many confirmed cases have there been in India overall?
-> How many recovered cases are there in around the world ?
-> How many recovered cases are there in India ?
-> Can the COVID-19 Trend-Line be Predicted?
-> Find the countries with the highest death rates.
-> Where the lowest death rates can be observed.
-> Can we identify any variations between the COVID - 19 Cases Around the World?
-> Can we predict the sheet for reference and the future?
