This is a straightforward demonstration of how we can create various and intriguing charts, visualisations, and dashboards from the same data.

We asked the following queries before using the Covid-19 Dataset to produce graphics.

1) Which countries have the most confirmed cases overall?
2) How many recovered instances are there overall across all countries?
3) How many confirmed cases have there been in India overall?
4) How many recovered cases are there in around the world ?
5) How many recovered cases are there in India ?
6) Can the COVID-19 Trend-Line be Predicted?
7) Find the countries with the highest death rates.
8) Where the lowest deaths can be observed.
9) Can we identify any variations between the COVID - 19 Cases Around the World?
10) Can we predict the sheet for reference and the future?

### 1. Which countries have the most confirmed cases overall?

**We can see from the illustration above that the locations with the color red are the most affected, while those with the colour green are less so.
It is clear that the US has the greatest number of confirmed cases overall with 2151 million cases.**

### 2. How many recovered instances are there overall across all countries?

**All of the countries have relatively strong recovery rates.
The darkened area in the above illustration¬†indicates that INDIA has the highest rate of recovery.**

### 3. How many confirmed cases have there been in India overall?

**India has the highest recovery rate, as can be seen from the illustration above.**

### 5. How many recovered cases are there in India ?

![Recovered cases (INDIA)](https://github.com/023lawrence/Covid-19-Analysis/assets/66831315/3550152b-e969-4abd-a485-8d740e5b335a)

**Maharashtra has India's highest recovery rate, according to the above illustration, and 1142 million cases have been recovered overall in India.**

### 6. Can the COVID-19 Trend-Line be Predicted?

![TrendLine Confirmed (international](https://github.com/023lawrence/Covid-19-Analysis/assets/66831315/87a93bc1-4fea-4eb6-9013-15e461acc0fd)
![TrendLine Confirmed (india)](https://github.com/023lawrence/Covid-19-Analysis/assets/66831315/2f373d97-211f-459b-b239-58e103f74f97)

 **The number of COVID-19 cases has been declining worldwide and in India as there is a drop in cases after 2021**
 
 ### 7. Find the countries with the highest death rates.
 
 ![DeathRate (international)](https://github.com/023lawrence/Covid-19-Analysis/assets/66831315/3dcef8ba-7053-47c7-826c-310e828ab6ad)
 
![Deaths International](https://github.com/023lawrence/Covid-19-Analysis/assets/66831315/9f9367c1-088f-4c6b-929b-033af908b4cb)
**
Countries with highest deaths are :-
1) US
2) Brazil
3) India**

### 8. Where the lowest deaths can be observed.

![Lowest deaths International](https://github.com/023lawrence/Covid-19-Analysis/assets/66831315/9572ad43-8800-4352-9a4b-77b2e0abbc4f)

**Countries with very less population has lowest deaths.**

### 9. Can we identify any variations between the COVID - 19 Cases Around the World?

![Variation C-19](https://github.com/023lawrence/Covid-19-Analysis/assets/66831315/274d8b6f-c822-49a1-837e-4ab86cf206ff)

**Countries such as Iran and US has highest variation in COVID - 19 around the the world.**  

### 10. Can we predict the sheet for reference and the future?

![Forecast of C-19](https://github.com/023lawrence/Covid-19-Analysis/assets/66831315/1cd807a7-0da1-45ef-8a60-bb580c994fc4)

**From the above¬†illustration, it is clearly seen¬†that the incidence of COVID-19 is forecasted to decline¬†in the years 2021‚Äì2022.**
